## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to use location data to solve a real-world business problem. The project explores location data using Foursquare API to help individuals or businesses make informed decisions based on their needs.

For example, we may explore neighborhoods in a city to identify the best locations for opening a restaurant, starting a new business, or comparing similarities and differences between two cities. The aim is to provide actionable insights to stakeholders, making this project a valuable data-driven solution.

## Data

The project uses various data sources, including:

1. **Foursquare API**: For location data, such as venue information and categories.
2. **Wikipedia**: For scraping and wrangling additional geographical information.
3. **Open datasets**: As needed for supplementary analysis.

The dataset includes latitude, longitude, venue categories, and other relevant features.

## Methodology

### Step 1: Data Collection and Wrangling

- Collected data from Foursquare API and other sources.
- Scraped neighborhood data from Wikipedia for Toronto or other selected cities.
- Cleaned and structured the data into pandas dataframes.

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted EDA to uncover key insights and trends.
- Visualized neighborhoods and venues using Folium maps.

### Step 3: Clustering Analysis

- Applied K-means clustering to group neighborhoods based on venue data.
- Used visualization to display cluster results and provide recommendations.

### Step 4: Predictive Analysis

- Built machine learning models (if applicable) to predict or classify specific outcomes based on the data.

### Step 5: Dashboard Development

- Created interactive dashboards using Plotly Dash to present findings.

## Results

- Visualizations of neighborhood clusters and venues.
- Recommendations for businesses based on venue popularity and cluster characteristics.
- Interactive maps and dashboards to explore findings.
